## 🎯 Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended - 3 Minutes)

This is the easiest and most reliable method.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

**Option A: If you already have a Git repository**
1. Copy all files from the deployment package to your repository
2. Make sure `vercel.json` and updated `package.json` are included
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration"
   git push
   ```

**Option B: Create a new Git repository**
1. Extract the deployment package
2. Navigate to the fluentry folder
3. Initialize Git (if not already):
   ```bash
   cd fluentry
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Fluentry English Learning Platform"
   ```
4. Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
5. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel**: https://vercel.com
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account
3. **Click "Add New Project"**
4. **Import your repository**:
   - Select your Git provider
   - Find and select the fluentry repository
   - Click "Import"

5. **Configure the project** (Vercel will auto-detect most settings):
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (leave as default)
   - **Build Command**: `pnpm build:vercel` (auto-detected from vercel.json)
   - **Output Directory**: `dist/public` (auto-detected from vercel.json)
   - **Install Command**: `pnpm install` (auto-detected)

6. **Click "Deploy"**

7. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the build to complete

8. **Your site is live!** 🎉
   - Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://fluentry-xyz.vercel.app`
   - You can add a custom domain later

---

### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Advanced)

If you prefer command-line deployment:

#### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

#### Step 2: Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate.

#### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
cd fluentry
vercel
```

Follow the prompts:
- **Set up and deploy?** → Yes
- **Which scope?** → Select your account
- **Link to existing project?** → No
- **Project name?** → fluentry (or your preferred name)
- **Directory?** → ./ (current directory)
- **Override settings?** → No (vercel.json will be used)

#### Step 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Your site is now live!

## 📋 Vercel Configuration Explained

### vercel.json

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm build:vercel",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "devCommand": "pnpm dev",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  "framework": null,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What each setting does:**

- **buildCommand**: Runs the Vercel-specific build (frontend only, no backend)
- **outputDirectory**: Where the built files are located
- **devCommand**: Command for local development
- **installCommand**: How to install dependencies
- **framework**: Set to null to use custom configuration
- **rewrites**: Enables SPA routing (all routes redirect to index.html)

### package.json Updates

Added new script:
```json
"build:vercel": "vite build"
```

This builds only the frontend (perfect for Vercel's static hosting).

## 🔧 Build Verification

The build has been tested and verified:

```
✓ 1623 modules transformed.
../dist/public/index.html                 365.82 kB │ gzip: 104.87 kB
../dist/public/assets/index-D9XiihXx.css  123.18 kB │ gzip:  19.17 kB
../dist/public/assets/index-CkTpCtzP.js   363.86 kB │ gzip: 102.40 kB
✓ built in 3.65s
```

**Status**: ✅ **CLEAN BUILD - VERCEL READY**

## 🌐 After Deployment

### Your Site Features

Once deployed, your Fluentry platform will include:

- ✅ **Home Page** - Hero section with call-to-action
- ✅ **About Page** - Founder story and mission
- ✅ **Courses Page** - Course offerings
- ✅ **Pricing Page** - Transparent pricing plans
- ✅ **Free Test Page** - Interactive AI English test
- ✅ **Book Lesson Page** - Easy booking via Calendly/WhatsApp
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
- ✅ **Fast Performance** - Optimized for speed

### Custom Domain (Optional)

To add your own domain:

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click **Settings** → **Domains**
3. Click **Add Domain**
4. Enter your domain (e.g., `fluentry.com`)
5. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
6. Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)

### Environment Variables (If Needed)

If you want to add analytics or other services later:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add your variables (e.g., `VITE_ANALYTICS_ID`)
3. Redeploy the site

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Functionality

The test result saving feature uses SQLite, which **will not work on Vercel** (Vercel is serverless and stateless).

**For production**, you have two options:

**Option 1: Remove Database Features (Simplest)**
- The site works perfectly without database
- Test results won't be saved (users can still take tests)
- No changes needed

**Option 2: Add External Database (Recommended for Production)**
- Use **Vercel Postgres** (built-in)
- Use **Supabase** (free tier available)
- Use **MongoDB Atlas** (free tier available)
- Use **PlanetScale** (MySQL)

To add a database later, you'll need to:
1. Create a database account
2. Update the API endpoints to use the new database
3. Add environment variables in Vercel
4. Redeploy

### Static Site Only

Vercel will deploy your site as a **static site** (no Node.js backend). This is perfect for your use case because:

- ✅ All pages work correctly
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ Forms work (submit to external services)
- ✅ External links work (WhatsApp, Calendly)
- ✅ Tests work (client-side only)
- ⚠️ Test results won't be saved to database

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Problem**: Build fails with "Command not found: pnpm"

**Solution**: Vercel should auto-detect pnpm from `package.json`. If not:
1. Go to **Settings** → **General**
2. Set **Install Command** to: `npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install`

---

**Problem**: Build fails with module errors

**Solution**: 
1. Check that all files are committed to Git
2. Ensure `node_modules` is in `.gitignore`
3. Redeploy

---

### Site Shows 404

**Problem**: Routes show 404 error

**Solution**: 
- Ensure `vercel.json` is in the repository root
- Check that the rewrites configuration is present
- Redeploy

---

### Slow Build Times

**Problem**: Build takes too long

**Solution**: This is normal for first deployment. Subsequent deployments will be faster due to caching.

---

## 📊 Performance Optimization

Vercel automatically provides:

- ✅ **Global CDN** - Fast loading worldwide
- ✅ **Automatic HTTPS** - Secure by default
- ✅ **Compression** - Gzip/Brotli enabled
- ✅ **Caching** - Smart caching for assets
