                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Technique 1: Shadow Speaking</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Shadow speaking means listening to native English audio and repeating it immediately, trying to match the pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation exactly.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">How to do it:</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Choose a short audio clip (30-60 seconds) from a podcast, TED talk, or movie scene</li>
                  <li>Listen to it several times to understand the meaning</li>
                  <li>Play it again and speak along with it, matching every word</li>
                  <li>Focus on copying the speaker's rhythm, stress, and intonation—not just the words</li>
                  <li>Practice the same clip daily for a week</li>
                </ol>

                <p className="font-semibold">Why it works:</p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  Shadow speaking trains your mouth muscles to produce English sounds naturally. It also helps you internalize the rhythm and melody of English, making your speech sound more natural.
                </p>

                  <p className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">✓ Student Success Story:</p>
                  <p className="text-green-800">
                    "After 3 months of shadow speaking for 15 minutes daily, my colleagues at work started asking if I lived abroad. My pronunciation improved dramatically!" - Youssef, Casablanca
                  </p>
                </div>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Technique 2: The 30-Second Challenge</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Set a timer for 30 seconds and speak continuously about any topic without stopping, pausing, or translating in your head.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">How to do it:</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Pick a simple topic (your morning routine, your favorite food, your city)</li>
                  <li>Set a 30-second timer</li>
                  <li>Start speaking and don't stop until the timer ends</li>
                  <li>If you don't know a word, describe it or use a simpler word</li>
                  <li>Record yourself to track progress</li>
                  <li>Gradually increase to 1 minute, then 2 minutes</li>
                </ol>

                <p className="font-semibold">Why it works:</p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  This technique forces you to think in English and keep speaking even when you're unsure. It builds fluency by training you to communicate your ideas, even with limited vocabulary.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Technique 3: Conversation Simulation</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Practice real-life conversations by yourself before they happen. Prepare for common situations you'll face.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">How to do it:</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Think of situations where you'll need English (job interview, restaurant, meeting)</li>
                  <li>Write down key phrases and vocabulary you'll need</li>
                  <li>Practice both sides of the conversation out loud</li>
                  <li>Imagine different scenarios and how you'd respond</li>
                  <li>Record yourself and listen back</li>
                </ol>

                <p className="font-semibold">Common scenarios to practice:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Introducing yourself professionally</li>
                  <li>Ordering food at a restaurant</li>
                  <li>Making phone calls</li>
                  <li>Asking for directions</li>
                  <li>Job interviews</li>
                  <li>Small talk with colleagues</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="font-semibold">Why it works:</p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  When you practice conversations beforehand, you're prepared when the real situation happens. You'll feel more confident and speak more naturally because you've already "rehearsed."
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Technique 4: Voice Journaling</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Instead of writing a journal, record yourself speaking about your day, thoughts, or feelings in English.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">How to do it:</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Use your phone's voice recorder</li>
                  <li>Spend 5-10 minutes daily talking about your day</li>
                  <li>Speak naturally, as if talking to a friend</li>
                  <li>Don't worry about mistakes—just keep talking</li>
                  <li>Listen to your recordings weekly to notice improvement</li>
                </ol>

                <p className="font-semibold">What to talk about:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>What you did today</li>
                  <li>Your plans for tomorrow</li>
                  <li>Something interesting you learned</li>
                  <li>Your opinion on a news story</li>
                  <li>A problem you're facing and possible solutions</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="font-semibold">Why it works:</p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  Voice journaling gives you daily speaking practice without needing a conversation partner. It also creates a record of your progress—you'll be amazed when you listen to recordings from a month ago!
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Technique 5: The Question-Answer Method</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Don't just listen to English content passively. Actively engage by asking and answering questions about what you hear or read.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">How to do it:</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Watch a short video or read an article in English</li>
                  <li>Pause and ask yourself questions about it (Who? What? Why? How?)</li>
                  <li>Answer your questions out loud in complete sentences</li>
                  <li>Explain the main ideas to yourself as if teaching someone</li>
                  <li>Give your opinion about the topic</li>
                </ol>

                <p className="font-semibold">Example:</p>
                <p className="mb-2">After watching a video about climate change:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>"What was the main problem discussed?" → Answer out loud</li>
                  <li>"Why is this important?" → Explain in your own words</li>
                  <li>"What do I think about this?" → Share your opinion</li>
                  <li>"How does this affect Morocco?" → Connect to your context</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="font-semibold">Why it works:</p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  This technique forces you to process information in English and express your thoughts. It develops both your comprehension and speaking skills simultaneously.
                </p>

                <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8">
                  <p className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">💡 Pro Tip:</p>
                  <p className="text-blue-800">
                    Combine these techniques! For example: Shadow speak for 10 minutes, then do the 30-second challenge, then voice journal about what you learned. This comprehensive approach will accelerate your progress.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Your 7-Day Speaking Challenge</h2>
                
                <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                  <p className="font-semibold mb-3">Day 1-2: Shadow Speaking</p>
                  <p className="mb-4">Choose one short clip and practice 15 minutes daily.</p>

                  <p className="font-semibold mb-3">Day 3-4: 30-Second Challenge</p>
                  <p className="mb-4">Practice speaking continuously about 5 different topics.</p>

                  <p className="font-semibold mb-3">Day 5: Conversation Simulation</p>
                  <p className="mb-4">Prepare and practice 3 common scenarios.</p>

                  <p className="font-semibold mb-3">Day 6: Voice Journaling</p>
                  <p className="mb-4">Record yourself talking about your week for 10 minutes.</p>

                  <p className="font-semibold mb-3">Day 7: Question-Answer Method</p>
                  <p>Watch a TED talk and practice asking/answering questions about it.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Most Important Thing</h2>
                
                <p>
                  All these techniques work, but only if you practice consistently. Speaking English is like building a muscle—you need regular exercise, not occasional intense workouts.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Start with just one technique for 15 minutes daily. Once it becomes a habit, add another. In 3 months, you'll be amazed at your progress.
                </p>
