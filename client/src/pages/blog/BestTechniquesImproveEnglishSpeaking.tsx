                  Want to finally speak English fluently and confidently? These five practical techniques have helped hundreds of my students in Morocco and abroad go from shy, hesitant speakers to confident communicators. I've seen real transformations ‚Äî and if you stay consistent, you'll notice the same change in just a few weeks.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1Ô∏è‚É£ Shadow Speaking ‚Äì Train Your Ear, Tongue, and Confidence</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Listen, repeat, and imitate ‚Äî that's the secret. Choose a short audio clip from a podcast, TED Talk, or movie, then shadow it. Try to match every sound, every rhythm, every emotion.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">üéß How to start:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Pick a 30-second clip you enjoy</li>
                  <li>Listen first for meaning, then for sound</li>
                  <li>Speak along with it several times daily for a week</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="font-semibold">üí° Why it works:</p>
                <p className="mb-6">
                  Shadow speaking trains your mouth to move like a native speaker's. You don't just learn English ‚Äî you start feeling it.
                </p>

                <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 my-8">
                  <p className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">‚úì Student Success Story:</p>
                  <p className="text-green-800">
                    "After three months of shadow speaking 15 minutes a day, my colleagues asked if I'd studied abroad." ‚Äî Youssef (from Casablanca)
                  </p>
                </div>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2Ô∏è‚É£ The 30-Second Challenge ‚Äì Think in English, Not in Translation</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Set a timer for 30 seconds and talk without stopping. Don't worry about mistakes ‚Äî just keep speaking.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">üïí Try this:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Pick a topic: your city, your job, your morning routine</li>
                  <li>Talk for 30 seconds nonstop</li>
                  <li>Increase to 1 minute, then 2</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  This builds fluency fast ‚Äî it forces your brain to stay in English mode.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3Ô∏è‚É£ Conversation Simulation ‚Äì Rehearse Before Real Life</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Most people freeze because they haven't practiced the situations they'll face. Simulate them first.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">üé≠ Examples:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Job interviews</li>
                  <li>Ordering food</li>
                  <li>Talking to colleagues</li>
                  <li>Phone calls or meetings</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  Write key phrases, play both roles, and speak out loud. When the real moment comes, you'll sound calm and ready ‚Äî because you've already "been there."
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4Ô∏è‚É£ Voice Journaling ‚Äì Your Daily Confidence Habit</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Forget writing journals. Speak them. Every night, talk for 5-10 minutes about your day, your plans, or your thoughts. Use your phone's recorder ‚Äî no partner needed.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  After a few weeks, listen back. You'll be amazed at how much clearer and more natural your speech becomes.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5Ô∏è‚É£ The Question-Answer Method ‚Äì Train Your Mind to Respond in English</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Don't just read or watch passively. Engage. Ask yourself:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>Who? What? Why? How?</li>
                  <li>Answer aloud ‚Äî even if you're alone</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="font-semibold mt-4">For example, after watching a video on climate change:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                  <li>"What was the main problem?" ‚Üí Answer aloud</li>
                  <li>"Why is this important?" ‚Üí Explain it</li>
                  <li>"What's my opinion?" ‚Üí Say it in full sentences</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="mb-6">
                  This technique strengthens both understanding and spontaneous speaking.
                </p>
