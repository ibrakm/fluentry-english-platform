# Mailchimp Setup Guide for Fluentry

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a free Mailchimp account to manage your email newsletter and build a long-term relationship with your students.

## 1. Create Your Free Mailchimp Account

1.  Go to the [Mailchimp website](https://mailchimp.com/) and click on the "Sign Up Free" button.
2.  Fill in your email, a username, and a password. It's best to use your business email (`abirkabaj@gmail.com`) for this.
3.  Mailchimp will send a verification email. Click the link in the email to activate your account.
4.  Follow the prompts to set up your account. You'll be asked for your name, business name (Fluentry — English Coaching), address, and other details. This information is required by anti-spam laws.

## 2. Create Your Audience

Your "audience" is your list of email subscribers. Mailchimp automatically creates one for you.

1.  From your Mailchimp dashboard, go to **Audience** > **Audience dashboard**.
2.  You can rename your audience to something like "Fluentry Students & Leads" by going to **Manage Audience** > **Settings**.

## 3. Create a Welcome Email Automation

An automated welcome email is a powerful way to engage new subscribers. This email will be sent automatically to anyone who signs up through your website (e.g., after taking the CEFR test).

1.  Go to **Automations** > **Pre-built journeys**.
2.  Find the "Welcome new subscribers" automation and click on it.
3.  Choose your audience ("Fluentry Students & Leads").
4.  **Design the Email:**
    *   You can now design the email that new subscribers will receive.
    *   **Subject Line:** A good subject line could be: "Welcome to Fluentry! Here's your first English tip."
    *   **Content:**
        *   Thank them for signing up.
        *   Briefly re-introduce Fluentry and your coaching.
        *   **Offer immediate value.** This is crucial. For example, you could include a section like:

            > **Your First Fluency Tip: The Shadowing Technique**
            >
            > A great way to improve your pronunciation and fluency is a technique called "shadowing." Find a short audio or video clip of a native English speaker. Listen to it once, then play it again and try to speak along with the speaker, imitating their pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation as closely as possible. Do this for just 5 minutes a day, and you'll notice a huge difference!

        *   Include a call-to-action, like a link to the Free Resources page or the Booking page on your website.
5.  Once you're happy with the email design, start the automation.

## 4. How to Add Subscribers

There are two main ways to add subscribers to your audience:

*   **Manually:** You can manually add the email addresses of students who have given you permission. Go to **Audience** > **Add contacts** > **Add a subscriber**.
*   **Integration (Advanced):** In the future, the website's lead capture form (from the CEFR test) can be integrated directly with Mailchimp using its API. This would automatically add new leads to your audience. This is a more advanced step that can be implemented in a future development session.

## Next Steps

*   **Regular Newsletters:** Plan to send a newsletter once or twice a month with valuable content, such as links to your latest blog posts, new free resources, or special offers on coaching packages.
*   **Grow Your List:** Encourage website visitors and social media followers to sign up for your newsletter.

This email list is a valuable asset for your business. It allows you to build a community, nurture potential students, and grow your brand over the long term.
